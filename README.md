# POKEMON APP

Small part of a broader fighting game concept, designed as a simple web-app to deepen my understanding in REACT Hooks. 

In building this app I have used real world APIs to fetch from a [pokemon database](https://pokemondb.net/) with different locations and engage in a battle with a random pokemon fetched from the selected location.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory:

    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project's directory:

Replace <repository_directory> with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.

4. Install Dependencies

    Use npm to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command:

This command will read the package.json file in your project and install all the required packages.

5. Start the Project:

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start your project by running the following command:

This command will execute the script specified in your package.json file to start your application.

6. Access the Application:

    After running npm run start, your application should be up and running. Open a web browser and access it using the appropriate address and port (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
